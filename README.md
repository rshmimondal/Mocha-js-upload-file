# How to upload file on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Mocha-js-upload-file) for automation test in Mocha-js 

If you want to upload a file to the LambdaTest and use it in your Mocha-js automation test, you can follow the below steps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Mocha-selenium-sample).

# Steps:

### Step 1: Upload the file to LamdbaTest using API

Use the LambdaTest file upload API to upload the file to the backend -https://api.lambdatest.com/automation/api/v1/user-files


### Step 2: Pass file in capabilities

In the`conf/single.conf.js`file, you need to update the test capabilities and add the filename for the `lambda:userFiles` capability. For example, if two files with filenames `photo1.png` and `photo2.png`, it has to be passed like so in the capability:

```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': false, // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
        "lambda:userFiles": ["photo1.png","photo2.png"],
};
```


### Step 3: Use the file in your test

The files can be used in your test like so:

* For Windows:
```js
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']").sendKeys("C:\\Users\\ltuser\\Downloads\\photo1.png")
```
* For MacOS:
```js
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']").sendKeys("/Users/ltuser/Downloads/photo1.png")
```


## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```
